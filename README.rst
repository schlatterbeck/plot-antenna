This is a program to plot antenna-related data resulting from an antenna
simulation. It can read the text output produced by nec2c_ and my
python mininec port pymininec_. Most notably it can plot antenna
far-field pattern in both 2D (Azimuth and Elevation) and 3D (as a 3D
graphic that can be rotated and zoomed). It supports a local display
program (using matplotlib_) and a HTML output version that displays
everything using javascript (using plotly_). The program features a
``--help`` option. If the program called with ``--help`` does not
display a ``-H`` or ``--export-html`` option, you most likely do not
have a recent version of plotly_ installed. In that case only the
matplotlib_ variant is available.

The program started out as a companion-program to my pymininec_
project and is now an independent program.

The plot program can also display output files of nec2c_, not only
from pymininec_.

Standalone Plotting with Matplotlib
-----------------------------------

The default is to plot all available
graphics, including an interactive 3d view. In addition with the
``--azimuth`` or ``--elevation`` options you can get an Azimuth
diagram::

    plot-antenna --azimuth test/12-el-1deg.pout

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlatterbeck/plot-antenna/master/test/12-el-azimuth.png
    :align: center

or an elevation diagram::

    plot-antenna --elevation test/12-el-1deg.pout

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlatterbeck/plot-antenna/master/test/12-el-elevation.png
    :align: center

respectively. Note that I used an output file with 1-degree resolution
in elevation and azimuth angles not with 5 degrees as in the example
above. The pattern look smoother but a 3D-view will be very slow due to
the large number of points. The plot program also has a ``--help``
option for further information. In particular the scaling of the antenna
plot can be selected using the ``--scaling-method`` option with an
additional keyword which can be one of ``linear``, ``linear_db``, and
``linear_voltage`` in addition to the default of ``arrl`` scaling. You
may consult Cebik's [1]_ article for explanation of the different
diagrams. The ``linear_voltage`` option is not explained by Cebik, it is
in-between the ``linear`` and ``linear_db`` scaling options.

The latest version accepts several plot parameters, ``--elevation``,
``--azimuth``, ``--plot3d``, ``--plot-vswr``, and ``--geo`` which are
plotted into one diagram. The default is to plot the first four graphs.
With the ``--output`` option pictures can directly be saved without
displaying the graphics on the screen. Note that unfortunately the
geometry display with the ``--geo`` option does not perform very well
because matplotlib_ has poor support for panning and scaling in 3D
plots.

The latest version has key-bindings for scrolling through the
frequencies of an antenna simulation. So if you have an output file with
a simulation of multiple frequencies (either with pymininec_ or
nec2c_) you can display diagrams for the next frequency by typing
``+``, and to the previous frequency by typing ``-``. For newer versions
of matplotlib_ you can display a scrollbar for the frequencies with
the ``--with-slider`` option.

Other keybindings switch the scaling for the antenna plots, ``a``
switches to ``arrl`` scaling, ``l`` switches to linear scaling, ``d``
switches to linear dB scaling, and ``v`` switches to linear voltage
scaling.

Finally the ``w`` key toggles display of the 3d diagram from/to
wireframe display. Note that the wireframe display may not be supported
on all versions of matplotlib_ and/or graphics cards.

Plotting for the Browser with Plotly
------------------------------------

All the plot supported for matplotlib_ are also supported with plotly_.
These are ``--elevation``, ``--azimuth``, ``--plot3d``, ``--plot-vswr``,
and ``--geo``. The plots can be either exported to a .html file using
the ``-H`` or ``--export-html`` option (with an additional filename to
export to) or injected into a running browser using the ``-S`` or
``--show-in-browser`` option.

Unlike for matplotlib_, each plot selected with an option is either
shown in a separate window in the browser or exported to a separate
file. If exporting to a file, additional output options can be selected
with the ``--html-export-option`` setting. The default is to export the
file with all javascript included (adds about 3MB to the file size).
With ``--html-export-option=directory`` the javascript is not included
and a ``plotly.min.js`` file is expected in the same directory as the
exported file. This file ships with the plotly_ distribution. When
exporting to a file, the plot name is appended to the file name given,
this allows export to several different plots in one program invocation.

The scaling variants selected with the ``--scaling-method`` option
cannot currently be changed at runtime with the plotly_ plots. As with
matplotlib_, the default is ``arrl`` scaling.

All plots are interactive. For the far-field pattern
plots (Azimuth, Elevation, 3D) frequencies can be selected in the legend
to the right of the plot. With mouse-over you can see the current angle
(Elevation or Azimuth with the 2D plots and both for the 3D plot) and
the gain at that point. For the 2D variants, more than one frequency can
be selected for plotting. This allows comparison of pattern between
different frequencies. For the 3D plot, the frequencies in the legend
act like radio-buttons, only one at a time can be selected.

With the --geo option you get a display of the antenna geometry.
Unfortunately plotly_ seems to have limitations on the zoom depths, so
for large antennas it is not possible to see the plot in deep detail. As
of this writing not all geometry details are displayed. In particular 2D
patches in NEC, transmission lines in NEC, and visualization of loaded
segments (e.g. with a capacity) are not shown.
