This is a program to plot antenna-related data resulting from an antenna
simulation. It can read the text output produced by nec2c_, my
python mininec port pymininec_, output from the original Basic
implementations of Mininec_, ASAP_, and with a separate command-line
tool the output of 3D antenna pattern from EZNEC_.

Most notably it can plot antenna
far-field pattern in both 2D (Azimuth and Elevation) and 3D (as a 3D
graphic that can be rotated and zoomed). It supports a local display
program (using matplotlib_) and a HTML output version that displays
everything using javascript (using plotly_). The program features a
``--help`` option.

The program started out as a companion-program to my pymininec_
project and is now an independent program.

The plot program can also display output files of nec2c_, ASAP_, and
EZNEC_, not only from pymininec_.

Standalone Plotting with Matplotlib
-----------------------------------

The default is to plot all available
graphics, including an interactive 3d view. In addition with the
``--azimuth`` or ``--elevation`` options you can get an Azimuth
diagram::

    plot-antenna --azimuth test/12-el-1deg.pout

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlatterbeck/plot-antenna/master/test/12-el-azimuth.png
    :align: center

or an elevation diagram::

    plot-antenna --elevation test/12-el-1deg.pout

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlatterbeck/plot-antenna/master/test/12-el-elevation.png
    :align: center

respectively. Note that I used an output file with 1-degree resolution
in elevation and azimuth angles not with 5 degrees as in the example
above. The pattern look smoother but a 3D-view in matplotlib_ will be
very slow due to the large number of points. This problem does not occur
when using the plotly_ backend.

The plot program also has a ``--help``
option for further information. In particular the scaling of the antenna
plot can be selected using the ``--scaling-method`` option with an
additional keyword which can be one of ``linear``, ``linear_db``, and
``linear_voltage`` in addition to the default of ``arrl`` scaling. You
may consult Cebik's [1]_ article for explanation of the different
diagrams. The ``linear_voltage`` option is not explained by Cebik, it is
in-between the ``linear`` and ``linear_db`` scaling options.

The latest version accepts several plot parameters, ``--elevation``,
``--azimuth``, ``--plot3d``, ``--plot-vswr``, and ``--geo`` which are
plotted into one diagram. The default is to plot the first four graphs.
With the ``--output`` option pictures can directly be saved without
displaying the graphics on the screen. Note that unfortunately the
geometry display with the ``--geo`` option does not perform very well
because matplotlib_ has poor support for panning and scaling in 3D
plots. It works fine with the plotly_ backend.

There are sub-options that change the behavior of the main option. For
the SWR plot, coloring of Ham-Radio bands and the display of the antenna
impedance can be turned on with ``--swr-show-bands`` and
``--swr-show-impedance``, respectively. An example may look like the
following:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlatterbeck/plot-antenna/master/test/pics/M.3.6.3.swr_band_range.png
    :align: center

The latest version has key-bindings for scrolling through the
frequencies of an antenna simulation. These keybindings only work for
the matplotlib_ backend.  If you have an output file with
a simulation of multiple frequencies you can display diagrams for the
next frequency by typing ``+``, and to the previous frequency by typing
``-``. For newer versions of matplotlib_ you can display a scrollbar for
the frequencies with the ``--with-slider`` option.

Other keybindings switch the scaling for the antenna plots, ``a``
switches to ``arrl`` scaling, ``l`` switches to linear scaling, ``d``
switches to linear dB scaling, and ``v`` switches to linear voltage
scaling.

Finally the ``w`` key toggles display of the 3d diagram from/to
wireframe display. Note that the wireframe display may not be supported
on all versions of matplotlib_ and/or graphics cards.

Plotting for the Browser with Plotly
------------------------------------

All the plot supported for matplotlib_ are also supported with plotly_.
These are ``--elevation``, ``--azimuth``, ``--plot3d``, ``--plot-vswr``,
and ``--geo``. The plots can be either exported to a .html file using
the ``-H`` or ``--export-html`` option (with an additional filename to
export to) or injected into a running browser using the ``-S`` or
``--show-in-browser`` option.

Unlike for matplotlib_, each plot selected with an option is either
shown in a separate window in the browser or exported to a separate
file. If exporting to a file, additional output options can be selected
with the ``--html-export-option`` setting. The default is to export the
file with all javascript included (adds about 3MB to the file size).
With ``--html-export-option=directory`` the javascript is not included
and a ``plotly.min.js`` file is expected in the same directory as the
exported file. This file ships with the plotly_ distribution. When
exporting to a file, the plot name is appended to the file name given,
this allows export to several different plots in one program invocation.

The scaling variants selected with the ``--scaling-method`` option
cannot currently be changed at runtime with the plotly_ plots. As with
matplotlib_, the default is ``arrl`` scaling.  When using scaling in dB,
the minimum dB value can be specified with the ``--scaling-mindb``
option.

Like with matplotlib_ there are sub-options that change the behavior of
the main option. For the SWR plot, coloring of Ham-Radio bands and the
display of the antenna impedance can be turned on with
``--swr-show-bands`` and ``--swr-show-impedance``, respectively

All plots are interactive. For the far-field pattern
plots (Azimuth, Elevation, 3D) frequencies can be selected in the legend
to the right of the plot. With mouse-over you can see the current angle
(Elevation or Azimuth with the 2D plots and both for the 3D plot) and
the gain at that point. For the 2D variants, more than one frequency can
be selected for plotting. This allows comparison of pattern between
different frequencies. For the 3D plot, the frequencies in the legend
act like radio-buttons, only one at a time can be selected.

With the ``--geo`` option you get a display of the antenna geometry.
Unfortunately plotly_ seems to have limitations on the zoom depths, so
for large antennas it is not possible to see the plot in deep detail. As
of this writing not all geometry details are displayed. In particular 2D
patches in NEC and transmission lines in NEC are not shown.

Input Sources
-------------

As already mentioned previously, plot-antenna_ can take input produced
by a couple of antenna simulation tools. Originally written for my
re-implementation of Mininec_, pymininec_, it can also use the output
from the original Mininec_ written in Basic, from nec2c_, and from
the Antenna Scatterers Analysis Program ASAP_. It automatically
detects in which format the input is and acts accordingly.

In addition there is a separate command-line tool, ``plot-eznec`` that
can be used to visualize the output from EZNEC_'s export function.

It has also been used for visualizing antenna measurement data. An
example from a contributed measurement is here:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlatterbeck/plot-antenna/master/test/pics/M.3.6.3.measurement_full.png
    :align: center

Note that for the measurement-data the unit of the data is not in dBi
but (because it was measured and not calibrated to dBi) in dBm. The
measurements were separate for horizontal and vertical polarization.

Release Notes
-------------

v2.0: More input formats

- Import from EZNEC_ exported pattern data
- Import from the Antenna Scatterers Analysis Program ASAP_
- Import from ancient Mininec_ versions written in Basic
- Add a ``--maxgain`` option to normalize the gain of the outer ring
- Display polarization for plotly when the single polarization is not
  "sum".
- Title added for geo, 3d, and swr plots
- Add more tests
- Tests: Now use explicitly-stored pictures instead of only picture
  hashes: It is much easier if we can compare the produced picture to
  the expected picture.
- Numerous bug-fixes

v1.8: Allow plotting of measurement data

- Deal with sparse matrix for plot values
- Interpolation of measured values in Phi (Azimuth) direction
- Add STL output of 3d pattern with optional library
- Allow setting the dB-unit (e.g. dBm for measurements)
- Allow plotting by polarization
- Version computation changed to allow install from git url

Note: Smith chart with matplotlib currently needs my
`patched pySmithPlot`_ library. You can install this with::

 python -m pip install pysmithplot@git+https://github.com/schlatterbeck/pySmithPlot.git

v1.7: Add Smith charts, optionally show impedance and band in VSWR plots

Many of the changes in this and several previous versions were suggested
by Rob Banfield, DM1CM: Adding the bands and impedance to the VSWR plot
are his idea as well as adding a Smith chart. Due to his attention to
detail this release corrects a lot of rough edges of previous versions.
Thanks Rob!

- The aspect ratio in 3D plotly plots is now correct. It used to be a
  little too wide in the X direction
- Add Smith chart display
- Options to add the impedance (either as real/imag or \|Z\|/phi (Z)) in
  the VSWR plot
- Option to show the ham radio bands in the VSWR plot
- Show loads and excitation(s) in geo plot, add ground to geo plot
- Margin of 3D plots in plotly are much wider now by default and can be
  configured with an option
- The style how the gain is displayed in the plotly 3D color bar can now
  be configured to save space (either relative or absolute gain in dB or
  dBi, the default is both)
- When there is only one frequency in the 3D plot, remove the frequency
  legend
- Add LICENSE file and pyproject.toml for newer install mechanisms in
  python
- Add tests for plotly output
- Use ppm images for the tests, the previously-used png images did
  contain the matplotlib version and thus were different for each
  version |--| the ppm images do not have that problem, there are still
  many differences with different matplotlib versions

v1.6: More SWR plot changes

- Make SWR-plot vertical line colors configurable
- Rename elevation-angle and azimuth-angle options to angle-elevation
  and angle-azimuth so that we can again request an elevation/azimuth
  plot with shortened options like ``--ele`` or ``--azi``
- Sort options lexicographically on ``--help``

v1.5: Allow target SWR frequency in VSWR plot

- Add command-line option ``--target-swr-frequency``
- Draw user-specifed target frequency in red, best (minimum) swr in grey

v1.4: Reset button and VSWR-Plot improvements

- Add grid and minimum-SWR vertical line to VSWR plot
- Remove display of frequency in mouse-over (in polar plots and 3D plot)
- Make polar reset button reset more parameters

v1.3: Add a reset button to plotly polar plots

- The polar plots, when zoomed in, could only be reset to the unzoomed
  view with a double-click. All other plots do have a reset button, add
  one for the polar plots, too.

v1.2: Allow specification of title (legend) font size in plotly version

- For some application (e.g. when using the plotly graphics inside a
  html iframe) the title (or we may want to call it legend) of the
  graphics may collide with the graphics itself. We can now specify the
  font size with ``--title-font-size``. This option currently works only
  with plotly graphics.

v1.1: Specification of azimuth / elevation angle

- Now we can specify an azimuth angle for elevation plot and an
  elevation angle for azimuth plots.
- Bug-fix in computation of maximum gain azimuth direction: If the
  maximum gain in theta direction goes up or down, the azimuth angle
  would be computed incorrectly because all gain values at that theta
  angle are the same for all azimuth angles.
- Sort options: Since there are some options that only exist when some
  packages are installed we sort options instead of trying to add them
  in the correct order.
