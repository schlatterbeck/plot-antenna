This is a program to plot antenna-related data resulting from an antenna
simulation. It can read the text output produced by nec2c_ and my
python mininec port pymininec_. Most notably it can plot antenna
far-field pattern in both 2D (Azimuth and Elevation) and 3D (as a 3D
graphic that can be rotated and zoomed). It support a local display
program (using matplotlib_) and a HTML output version that displays
everything using javascript (using plotly_). The program features a
``--help`` option. If the program called with ``--help`` does not
display a ``-H`` or ``--export-html`` option, you most likely do not
have a recent version of plotly_ installed. In that case only the
matplotlib_ variant is available.

The program started out as a companion-program to my pymininec_
project and is now an independent program.

Plotting
--------

The default is to plot all available
graphics, including an interactive 3d view. In addition with the
``--azimuth`` or ``--elevation`` options you can get an Azimuth
diagram::

    plot-antenna --azimuth test/12-el-1deg.pout

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlatterbeck/pymininec/master/test/12-el-azimuth.png
    :align: center

or an elevation diagram::

    plot-antenna --elevation test/12-el-1deg.pout

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlatterbeck/pymininec/master/test/12-el-elevation.png
    :align: center

respectively. Note that I used an output file with 1-degree resolution
in elevation and azimuth angles not with 5 degrees as in the example
above. The pattern look smoother but a 3D-view will be very slow due to
the large number of points. The plot program also has a ``--help``
option for further information. In particular the scaling of the antenna
plot can be ``linear``, ``linear_db``, and ``linear_voltage`` in
addition to the default of ``arrl`` scaling. You may consult Cebik's [1]_
article for explanation of the different diagrams.

The latest version accepts several plot parameters, ``--elevation``,
``--azimuth``, ``--plot3d``, ``--plot-vswr`` which are plotted into one
diagram. The default is to plot all four graphs. With the ``--output``
option pictures can directly be saved without displaying the graphics on
the screen.

The plot program can also display output files of nec2c_, not only
from pymininec_.

The latest version has key-bindings for scrolling through the
frequencies of an antenna simulation. So if you have an output file with
a simulation of multiple frequencies (either with pymininec_ or
nec2c_) you can display diagrams for the next frequency by typing
``+``, and to the previous frequency by typing ``-``. For newer versions
of matplotlib_ you can display a scrollbar for the frequencies with
the ``--with-slider`` option.

Other keybindings switch the scaling for the antenna plots, ``a``
switches to ``arrl`` scaling, ``l`` switches to linear scaling, ``d``
switches to linear dB scaling, and ``v`` switches to linear voltage
scaling.

Finally the ``w`` key toggles display of the 3d diagram from/to
wireframe display. Note that the wireframe display may not be supported
on all versions of matplotlib_ and/or graphics cards.
