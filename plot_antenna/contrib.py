    """ Parses measurement data from CSV file
        This has the columns:
        - Messwert: The measurement
        - Einheit Messwert: Unit of the measurement (e.g. dBm)
        - Position Drehscheibe: Azimuth angle
        - Position Positionierer: Elevation angle
        - Polarisation: 'PH' for horizontal, 'PV' for vertical polarization
        - Messfrequenz: frequency
        - Einheit Messfrequenz: unit of frequency
        For an example see test/Messdaten.csv
        The format has the following peculiarities:
        - The elevation angles slightly vary for a single azimuth scan.
          This means we may have 10° and some values at 10.1°. Since the
          elevation angle steps are 10° we round to the nearest integer.
        - Azimuth is scanned continuously, so azimuth angles do not
          match at all for two different elevation angles. This still
          means we can plot an azimuth polarization diagram. But for
          elevation or 3d plots we need to interpolate the azimuth
          angles. For this the --interpolate-azimuth-step option was
          added. Typically we interpolate the azimuth values to e.g. a
          2° grid.
        - Some azimuth angles are greater than 360°.
